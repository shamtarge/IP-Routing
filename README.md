# IP-Routing

#What is IP Routing:
* A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer network. 
* When a data packet arrives at a router port, the router reads address information in packet to determine which port the packet will be sent.

#What my project does:
* It takes multiple data packet's Network IP Address as input and outputs the Destination Gateway IP Address and Port IP.
